Makefile for installing flutter with one command
================================================

This Makefile by now only works if you use the bash (ohmyzsh is by now not supported, but might come up next - maybe you like to add and do a pullrequest?)

Requirements
------------

* Makefile (better use a plugin for Visual Studio Code or editor of your choice to keep tabs)
* Makefile related I suggest using MacOS or Linux
* On Windows Makefile is not that well supported (you need to install it for Windows or might work in build in Linux)
* Git

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pkropp/flutter
```

```bash
$ cd flutter
```

```bash
$ make flutter
```
